### IDE
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. An IDE is basically a text editor with bells and whistles.
For example, you can usually tell someone is coding when their computer screen is full of text in different colors.
This is called syntax highlighting and it is a feature of most IDEs.

We recommend JetBrains. You can [get a student license here](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students).

And [here is a nifty site](https://pypl.github.io/IDE.html) that shows popular IDEs based on Google searches.
